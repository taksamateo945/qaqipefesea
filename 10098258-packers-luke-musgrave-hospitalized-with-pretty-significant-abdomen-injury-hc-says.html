"He didn't say anything all game. ... He's been in the hospital. This kid is as tough as they come."</p>Eli Berkovits <span class=acct>@BookOfEli_NFL</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Matt Lafleur just said that Luke Musgrave has a "pretty significant injury... He's been in the hospital."&lt;br>&lt;br>Lafleur continued to say that Musgrave is no longer in the hospital, so that's good.</p>Wes Hodkiewicz <span class=acct>@WesHod</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Matt LaFleur says Luke Musgrave "has a pretty significant injury" and was in the hospital. He didn't say anything during the game and then called trainer Bryan Engel afterwards.&lt;br>&lt;br>"He's going to be a very dynamic player in time. A significant blow for us, offensively" &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Packers?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Packers&lt;/a></p><p>Per <a href=# rel=noopener>Eric Boynton</a> of WBAY-TV 2, FOX cameras showed Musgrave grabbing his side after falling hard following a diving third-quarter catch. He finished with four receptions for 28 yards.</p><p>The Packers play the Detroit Lions on Thursday at 12:30 p.m. ET. Green Bay is not conducting practices this week leading into the game, so practice reports are an estimation of a player's participation level. However, <a href=# rel=noopener>Musgrave was listed</a> as a DNP (did not practice) Tuesday.</p><p>Hopefully Musgrave is able to return to full health soon. He's obviously made a good impression during his rookie year after the Packers selected him No. 42 overall in the draft out of Oregon State. For the season, he's caught 33 passes for 341 yards and one score.</p><p>In the meantime, the Packers must figure out a new plan at tight end. With second-stringer Josiah Deguara (hip) also a DNP, the only remaining active tight ends on the roster are Tucker Kraft and Ben Sims, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Zack Kruse</a> of Packers Wire. At this point, it would seem like that duo will be leading the way at the position versus Detroit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaW1%2FdoSMqZico5WnwG641KScZqWlqLSzrdWeZKGno6W2ta3LorGenF2strW0jKmpnqykrnq0tcanoJ%2Bhk5a7tXnAm5uopZWjeqq6ya6psmWYmHq0rdis</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
