Can't score when you can't play due to a devastating knee injury. That's my fact. Now……what's y'all excuse for never winning anything???&lt;br>&lt;br>Can't wait to see y'all in April. May and June? We won't even go there! Good Luck! Tell my boys…Coach Green and CJ I'm always… &lt;a href="https://t.co/1G9ZzwFPbF">https://t.co/1G9ZzwFPbF&lt;/a></p><p><i>"Zion Williamson, it's not about his game. It's about how many burgers he's eating. And whether or not he is going to be in shape or is he going to keep eating McDonald's and have chefs clamoring for him to come to their restaurants. That what he has to prove, that the chefs don't love him any longer, OK? That he's committed to playing basketball and being in shape."</i></p><p>Williamson has averaged 22.5 points on 58.5 percent shooting, 5.4 rebounds and 4.9 assists for a 34-22 Pels team sitting fifth in the Western Conference after winning eight of nine.</p><p>This isn't the first time Smith has criticized Williamson for his weight, saying on his <a href=# rel=noopener>show</a> in December (h/t Jeff Smith of Sports Illustrated):</p><p>"Zion Williamson … went to the free throw line – Ladies and gentlemen, I saw a belly. A belly. Like, when he took a deep breath, his belly bounced," Smith said.</p><p>"What's up, Zion? It's bad enough getting your ass kicked … But you look like you showed up to the game having just ate a buffet. Not something from the buffet, I said the buffet. Like you ate the damn table...He's fat."</p><p>The Pels have notably had issues with Williamson's conditioning, work ethic and diet, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Christian Clark</a> of <i>The</i> <i>Times-Picayune</i> in December.</p><p>"Williamson's poor worth ethic has been a source of frustration for the Pelicans since they drafted him No. 1 in 2019. The Pelicans have tried to surround Williamson with veterans who have track records of maximizing their potential. The team signed <a href=# rel=noopener>JJ Redick</a> in 2019. In 2022, they traded for <a href=# rel=noopener>CJ McCollum</a>.</p><p>"None of it has made an impact.</p><p>"The Pelicans have repeatedly stressed to Williamson that his diet and conditioning need to improve. Williamson, multiple team sources have told <i>The Times-Picayune</i>, 'doesn't listen.'"</p><p>Willamson, who is in his fifth NBA season, is listed at <a href=# rel=noopener>6'6" and 284 pounds</a>. While he is on the heavier side, his weight won't matter if he's healthy and performing and the Pels are winning. That's happening at the moment with Williamson averaging 25.3 points during the Pels' latest hot stretch.</p><p>Of course, any further losing down the line could surely fire up the critics, but for now, the Pels are on a roll and will look to continue it Friday at home versus the Miami Heat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWWBdXyMqZyloZOWu7R50qGYnZ1dqMGmvMeepWaZXai6qsDHZqanZaOksKqty2aknpyZlnqistOeqWaymaS7bsPIpaOimZ2ovK95wqugraGTnsCu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
