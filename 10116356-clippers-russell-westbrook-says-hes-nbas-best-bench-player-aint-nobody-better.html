"We've been talking about it before—not him coming off the bench—but just about sacrificing for one another just so we could start winning. And he did that and wanted to come off the bench so we could be better. We've done so much in our careers already. So I think he just wants to have an opportunity to get there and win."</p><p>"We owed it to him to make it work," Paul George added. "All of us collectively, we know what sacrifice looks like now."</p><p>Head coach Tyronn Lue told Youngmisuk it was Westbrook who first approached him about making the change after the Clippers lost their first six games following the Harden trade.</p><p>"Ultimately, [it was] figuring out where the sacrifice is going to come from and who was going to take more of a sacrifice. And that came down to myself," Westbrook said. "The decision came to the ultimate big goal—to win the championship."</p><p>The Clippers were 3-7 at that time. They've gone 48-21 since.</p><p>As for whether Westbrook will be considered the Sixth Man of the Year for the 2023-24 season remains to be seen, though players like Bobby Portis (13.7 PPG, 7.3 RPG), Malik Monk (15.4 PPG, 5.1 APG) and Naz Reid (13.4 PPG, 5.3 RPG) all make compelling cases, among others.</p><p>There's no doubting that Westbrook's willingness to be a bench contributor has helped save his team's season, however.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWuAdoKMnKOiqKCav7R50a6qrJ2coXq4sdKtmaunn6B6tK3YrGShnaNiu6Ot0maZnqukYq%2BmusKhZKmkka6ys3nAoqWtZZ6kr7Cw2GaZnqykmr8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
