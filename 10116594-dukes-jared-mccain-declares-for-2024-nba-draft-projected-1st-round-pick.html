His pro comparison, according to Wasserman, is Toronto Raptors guard Immanuel Quickley.</p><p>Quickley was <a href=#>regarded</a> as an undersized guard with excellent shooting potential coming out of Kentucky in 2020. He was selected No. 25 overall by the Thunder, who traded his draft rights to the New York Knicks.</p><p>McCain had a strong season for the Blue Devils that included being named to the ACC All-Rookie team. He finished second on the team with 14.3 points per game on 41.4 percent three-point shooting.</p><p>The NCAA tournament was a good showcase for McCain. He scored 30 points on 10-of-15 shooting in a second-round win over James Madison.</p><p>McCain did his best to keep Duke in the game against North Carolina State in the Elite Eight. He dropped a game-high 32 points on 5-of-11 three-point shooting in the 76-64 loss to the Wolfpack.</p><p>The 2024 NBA draft will take place from June 26-27 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWuCeoCMnayknaNit6K%2BxJ1kppuTlravecOemqWZoprAbrLOq2RraGJpeq%2BuwGabq5mWqXqxvs6jnJyslZl6cr%2FTZqmorZ6ZerG1wqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
