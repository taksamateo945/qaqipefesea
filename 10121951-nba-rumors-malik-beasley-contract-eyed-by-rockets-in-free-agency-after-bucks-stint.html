And one name identified in that effort has reportedly been free-agent-to-be Malik Beasley.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Kelly Iko</a> of The Athletic, "Houston has identified floor spacing and shooting as an area of need this offseason privately and publicly and have an interest in veteran sharpshooter Beasley, league sources said."</p><p>Beasley, 27, averaged 11.3 points, 3.7 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 79 games (77 starts) for the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2023-24 season, shooting 44.3 percent from the field and a career-best 41.3 percent from three.</p><p>He's emerged as one of the league's more reliable options from beyond the arc, hitting on 38.5 percent of his threes during his career. That should make him a popular option for teams looking to add floor-spacing in free agency.</p><p>As Iko noted, both the Orlando Magic and Golden State Warriors also have interest in his services. Other teams in contending mode will likely inquire as well.</p><p>The Rockets, meanwhile, will have a few avenues to improve themselves this offseason.</p><p>For one, the team has the No. 3 overall pick. They could use that selection to add more young talent or package it in a trade for a veteran star. Iko noted that "talks have largely been informal, the bulk of concrete offers likely won't come in until draft night, but a handful of teams have expressed interest in acquiring the pick."</p><p>If the team does decide to sell the selection, one name to watch out for is Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell. Iko reported that the Rockets "are among those interested in the 27-year-old and have been monitoring his situation for months."</p><p>The team could also move down the draft board in an effort to add more assets overall.</p><p>The Rockets will be more limited in one they can do in free agency, however, likely only having access to the non-taxpayer midlevel exception and minimum contracts. Slotting a player like Beasley into that exception would make sense.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmaGdn2Mp5maZaKqurC%2B0makmqSZoHqjscCso56xXZi8r8DRmpqtZZWusqV5wbJkq6eToLK1v4yipWaeopqybq3GnqWcsV2Ws7Wx0WaZrpubqHq0wMinqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
