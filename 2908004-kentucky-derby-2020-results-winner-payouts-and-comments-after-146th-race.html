And he had a good run, staying neck-and-neck with Authentic for much of the race. But Authentic had the final kick, and trainer Bob Baffert had his sixth Kentucky Derby champion.</p><p>"I've had some great Derby rides, but what that guy did," Baffert said about jockey John&nbsp;<span>Velazquez, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a>.</span>&nbsp;"Johnny V. gave them the most incredible ride. The training was lights-out. He was fresh. He's a good horse. He's our No. 1 pick from the beginning, and here we are. The greatest race in the world, and I feel very blessed and fortunate."</p><p>Velazquez, meanwhile, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told reporters</a> the race was all about Authentic's performance:</p><p>"I give credit to the horse, really.&nbsp;If you don't have the horse underneath you, you can't win. We planned really well. I told Bob even that when we get to the lead, I'm not going into the rail. I wanted to see everybody outside of me.&nbsp;I was hoping that my horse responded to what I wanted him to do and Bob said to make sure you go left-handed (with the whip). It's a great feeling to have when you ask the horse for more and he gives you everything he can."</p><p>This was a performance worth remembering. Authentic's time of&nbsp;2:00.61 was the seventh fastest in the history of the race. He was the first wire-to-wire winner since 2002, when War Emblem pulled off the feat. And he knocked off an incredibly talented and hyped horse in Tiz the Law, whose 3-5 odds made him the largest favorite in&nbsp;31 years.</p>NBC Sports Bet <span class=acct>@NBCSportsBet</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>no one: Authentic bettors: https://t.co/NfyPNX9qM5</p>br_betting <span class=acct>@br_betting</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tiz The Law bettors rn https://t.co/6sGiefETVD</p><p>"Tiz has been able to pass horses all year and today he ran into one he couldn't get by," the horse's owner, <span>Jack&nbsp;</span>Knowlton, told ESPN. "Credit Authentic. He came from the far outside and managed to get to the lead and just ran a great race. No shame on our part."</p><p><span>Authentic was so good he even went full diva after the race, and everyone brushed themselves off and continued with the celebration:</span></p>Matt Stone <span class=acct>@mattstonephotog</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>That’s so 2020: #kyderby winner Authentic knocks down his trainer Bob Baffert as well as another man in the Winner’s Circle after knocking off favorite Tiz the Law. https://t.co/C9Fx3f05YD</p><p>"He spun around, and he was like a bowling ball. He just spun us all around,'' Baffert said. "The turf course is pretty soft here, so it wasn't too bad. I was probably more embarrassed than anything when I hit the ground."</p><p>A small price to pay for yet another Derby triumph.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXJoaGV9dXnKnqWtrZOgxm6wxKuZsmViZX9xedGeqq6kpKh6uLXNp5yrZaCWxrDB06xkmqaUYrCwucyepa2rXZaztbHRZmhtbqSderOtwp4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
