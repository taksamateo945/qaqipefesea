In 2019, she started dating prominent actor and director Zach Braff, well known for his role as John “J.D.” Dorian in the hospital drama Scrubs.</p><p>The social media connection between Florence Pugh and Zach Braff started in 2018 when Braff commended Pugh on Twitter for her performance in the historical drama Lady Macbeth.

So that’s what we did. When I speak about it, I get a knot in my throat.”</p><p>In light of the couple’s divorce, here are some lesser-known facts about Florence Pugh.</p><h2>3 facts about Florence Pugh that you may not be aware of</h2><h2>1) She loves both pets and plants.</h2><p>Florence Pugh is obsessed with succulents.

She also knows how to play the guitar and the piano. Pugh began her career by singing covers on YouTube as Flossie Rose before transitioning to acting. Among her most famous renditions is Bob Dylan’s song Make You Feel My Love and Oasis’ Wonderwall. Florence Pugh has a slew of high-profile movies coming out in 2022 and 2023, including Olivia Wilde’s, Don’t Worry Darling, in which she co-stars with Harry Styles, Gemma Chan, KiKi Layne, and Chris Pine.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Florence-Pugh.jpeg alt="Florence Pugh" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This will be followed by an adaptation of Emma Donoghue’s The Wonder and Christopher Nolan’s much-anticipated star-studded feature Oppenheimer, starring Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., and Rami Malek.
