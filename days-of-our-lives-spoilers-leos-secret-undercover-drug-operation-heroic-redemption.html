So, is it possible that Leo will decide to secretly go undercover and be Salem’s latest hero?</p><h2>Stefan DiMera’s Plea</h2><p>DOOL spoilers reveal that following the drug raid on the Bistro, Stefan and Ava Vitali (Tamara Braun) need damage control. Stefan went to ask Chad for a favor. Meanwhile, Ava decided to hire Stephanie Johnson (Abigail Klein) to handle the Bistro’s PR.</p><p>The episode that aired on Tuesday, January 23, 2024, showed Stefan stopping by The Spectator. Stefan had a huge favor to ask Chad.</p><h3>DOOL Spoilers: Chad DiMera’s Agreement</h3><p>Chad didn’t want to make the pact with Stefan. Chad knew that the decision wouldn’t go over well with Everett or Xander Cook (Paul Telfer). At the same time, Chad knows that Stefan and Ava are dealing with Clyde, the same person responsible for Abigail DiMera’s (Marci Miller) death. Chad also knows that Stefan’s wife, Gabi Hernandez-DiMera (last played by Camila Banus) was attacked in prison.</p><p>After the impromptu meeting, Chad announced to Everett, Leo, and Xander that they weren’t using the Bistro’s name in the drug articles.</p><p><img alt="Days Of Our Lives: Everett Lynch (Blake Berris)" width=730 height=411 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2024/01/days-of-our-lives-spoilers-leos-secret-undercover-drug-operation-heroic-redemption/ data-jpibfi-post-title="Days Of Our Lives Spoilers: Leo’s Secret, Undercover Drug Operation & Heroic Redemption?" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DOOL-Everett-Lynch.jpeg></p><h3>Everett Lynch’s Explosion</h3><p><a href=#>Days of Our Lives spoilers reveal that after Chad’s declaration</a>, Everett demanded answers. Everett feels strongly that The Spectator needs to report the truth. Chad said that the discussion was closed, and Everett had no choice but to get back to work.</p><h3>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Undercover Leo Stark</h3><p><a href=#>While Chad and Everett didn’t agree</a>, Leo continued to sit silently and just listened. Leo might get involved in the drug investigation. However, Leo often does things on his own rather than announcing his plans. So, we could totally see Leo going undercover secretly, then getting in way over his head.</p><p>Leo was almost redeemed through Jude Brady, but EJ DiMera (Dan Feuerriegel) didn’t believe him. So, Leo decided to focus on Sloan Petersen-Brady (Jessica Serfaty). Leo is pushing Sloan over the edge, so she could blurt out the baby truth. Of course, Leo might still get redemption with Nicole Walker-Brady (Arianne Zucker). At the same time, maybe Lady Whistleblower’s ticket to being one of the “good guys” is combating Salem’s drug crisis.</p><p>What do you think is going to happen between Chad and Everett? Will Leo end up going undercover and turn into Salem’s newest hero? Share your thoughts in the comment section below. Remember to keep watching the soap on Peacock to find out what happens next.</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with DOOL right now.
