On Tuesday, Ratajkowski stopped by the podcast Pretty Big Deal to chat with Ashley Graham. During their talk, Graham said, “Ratajkowski has always been known as a sexy girl.” The pregnant model then asked the actress how she felt about the label.
Graham wanted to know if it made Ratajkowski feel hurt or was it more of a superpower."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I think that I have a really complicated relationship to being sexy. I think that I have definitely found incredible power in it, just for myself. Like being empowered for myself. I’m not talking about power in like how much money I made or my career. I mean, like, in feeling good and powerful in my body. I’ve definitely been able to do that. I also think there’s another side of me that’s like every woman, where it’s like I’m so much more than just that,” replied the 32-year-old.</p><p>Ratajkowski and Graham both admitted they know first-hand what it is like to be placed in a box because of their physical appearances.
