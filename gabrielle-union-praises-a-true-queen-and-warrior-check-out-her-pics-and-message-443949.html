‘Today’s #WCW is @bethannhardison. Bethann is truly a queen and a warrior who has forever championed, supported, amplified, and protected the US. I met Bethann in NYC years ago and immediately I was struck by her unmatched beauty. She is, was, and forever will be STUNNING! At that first meeting, she gave me a soul hug and promptly hipped me to so much game."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I met Bethann in NYC years ago and immediately I was struck by her unmatched beauty. She is, was, and forever will be STUNNING! At that first meeting, she gave me a soul hug and promptly hipped me to so much game. That is who she is. Since the ’70s, she has been breaking barriers…’ Gabrielle began her post.</p><p>She continued and said: ‘like when she took the runway and print world by storm as a wildly successful model. One modeling highlight is when she was featured in the Battle of Versailles fashion face off. It was legendary and the American models + designers shut it down. She later shifted her focus from modeling to activism, and formed her own management agency, which set out to diversify the fashion industry. Alongside Iman, she also formed Black Girls Coalition (an advocacy and support group for African-American models). With this outstanding work, it’s no wonder her accolades are extensive including: CFDA Founders Award, and Woman of Power Legacy Award from Black Enterprise just to name a couple. Thank you for being a shining light to us all! Let us lift her up in the light of goodness and hold her there.’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CGDmykCAWX5/</p><p>A fan told her: ‘Love this! Thank you for sharing 😘’</p><p>Bethann wrote this in the comments: ‘WOW #WCW IMPRESSIVE !!! Love the respect and kudos. Haha, and the photos even when I was 9 yrs old. Lovely. I would have missed this after watching the VP debate as I am basically off the grid for awhile. I need&nbsp;to write, so glad I saw. Gracias mi amor por todos @gabunion 🙏🏾💙🙅🏾‍♂️ Wakanda.’</p><p>Another commenter posted this message: ‘Queen! I remember realizing that it wasn’t a coincidence that @kadeemhardison had her last name like “wait THEE Bethann Hardison is his mom????”’</p><p>In other news, <a title="Dwyane Wade Triggers A Debate Among Fans After Showing Support For ‘His Girls’" href=#>Gabrielle Union</a>&nbsp;looks amazing in this Miu Miu outfit.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>She shared some <a href=#>photos and a clip</a> on her social media account, and fans cannot stop praising her.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeXlq%2BztcSlo55lpaO2sLqMqamaoaOawG6tjK2prp1dpsKmsc1mmKecXayus77IqKlmm5iasKx5zq6rZqCVp3qxtcKsZJqmlGK6pr%2FSmp6eZWRpgHqAmGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
