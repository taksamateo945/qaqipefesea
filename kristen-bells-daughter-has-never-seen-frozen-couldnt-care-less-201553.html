Bell told Us of Lincoln Bell, whom she and husband <strong><a href=#>Dax Shepard</a></strong> welcomed in March 2013. "She is not my biggest fan. She just doesn't know what I do for a living!"&nbsp;</p><p>"She couldn’t care less. [It] is extremely humbling to come home to someone who couldn't care less about what you do!" the House of Lies star revealed to Us while promoting Oral-B and Crest's new line of Frozen-themed products.&nbsp;</p><p>Bell's unimpressed little girl, who turns 2 this month, became a big sister this past December. The Forgetting Sarah Marshall actress and Shepard, 40, added to their family with the birth of daughter <strong>Delta Bell</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"The APA recommends that you let kids watch TV when they're 2 and a half, so we’re trying to follow that, which unfortunately is not realistic for all parents — I understand, we’re shooting for the moon," Bell told Us of when she'll introduce Lincoln to the medium. "[It's also for] their imagination, just so they don’t become sedentary and used to zoning out to videos. But she's certainly seen videos, she loves the hell out of Snoopy! But we're trying. She certainly hasn’t seen anything Frozen."</p><p>Bell added that she is looking forward to exposing Lincoln to Anna, Elsa, and the ever-charming Olaf one day.&nbsp;</p><p>"It’s funny, I’m more excited as an audience member because of the sister themes," she gushed. "Because one day when I show it to both my girls together, it will have significance to them and their dynamic. I’m really excited about that because I think it really says something really special about sisters."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOpKmiq6Sau26uxKWjrGWUlsKotNOeqWagkah6r7HVnqlmq5Wau26y0aixnqZdmLy2uMOnq2abkaeybrjErKpmamBmgnZ%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
