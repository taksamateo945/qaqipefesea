But she told the interviewer: ‘That, for whatever reason, is not something that we were allowed to do, even though several other members of the family do that exact thing.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In fact, no other working royals are allowed to make their own money at the same time as performing official duties.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There are fears the Sussexes are planning to ramp up media appearances, culminating in the publication of Harry’s highly anticipated memoir. Sources have previously hinted at Harry’s ‘truth bombs’, of which there may be more to come.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the latest interview, Meghan hinted she had more to say about her life in the Royal Family, but was ‘still healing’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: ‘It’s interesting, I’ve never had to sign anything that restricts me from talking… I can talk about my whole experience and make a choice not to.’ Buckingham Palace declined to comment.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold><span class=mol-style-medium>‘Upsetting the dynamic of the Royal Family’</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meghan said that she and Prince Harry were ‘happy’ to leave Britain and were ‘upsetting the dynamic of the hierarchy… just by existing’ before they stepped down as frontline royals and moved to North America.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Cut reported today that 41-year-old Meghan listed a ‘handful of princes and princesses and dukes who have the very arrangement they wanted’, although none of these royals are named in the article.</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>Harry and Meghan’s visit to the UK and Germany&nbsp;</h3><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li class=class><span class=mol-style-bold>Monday, September 5</span>: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will travel to Manchester for the One Young World Summit, an event which brings together young leaders from more than 190 countries</li><li class=class><span class=mol-style-bold>Tuesday, September 6</span>: Harry and Meghan will head to Germany for the Invictus Games Dusseldorf 2023 One Year to Go event</li><li class=class><span class=mol-style-bold>Thursday, September 8</span>: The Sussexes then return to the UK for the WellChild Awards in London</li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font>And Meghan, speaking to New York-based features writer Allison P Davis, said: ‘That, for whatever reason, is not something that we were allowed to do, even though several other members of the family do that exact thing.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Asked ‘Why do you think that is?’, she simply replied: ‘Why do you think that is?’, with the interviewer Ms Davis saying that she said this ‘right back with a side-eye that suggests I should understand without having to be told’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The article states that Harry and Meghan suggested to ‘The Firm’ that they should be allowed to work on behalf of the monarchy but make their own money, with the Duchess saying: ‘Then maybe all the noise would stop.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The article says: ‘They also thought it best to leave the U.K. (and the U.K. press) to do it.
