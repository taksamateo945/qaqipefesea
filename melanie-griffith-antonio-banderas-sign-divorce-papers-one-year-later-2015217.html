A judge still needs to sign in order to finalize the split, but the site speculated that it would happen within a few days.</p><p>This marked Griffith's fourth marriage and divorce, and Banderas' second. The two split last June, releasing a joint statement to<strong> Us Weekly</strong> about the end of their marriage. "We have thoughtfully and consensually decided to finalize our almost 20-year marriage in a loving and friendly manner," the couple told <strong>Us,</strong> "honoring and respecting each other, our family and friends, and the beautiful time we have spent together."</p><p>In the months following their separation news, Banderas was seen getting cozy with a handful of younger women in St. Tropez. Griffith, meanwhile, made headlines last summer when she noticeably <a href=#>began lasering off her famous "Antonio" tattoo</a> in multiple treatments.</p><p>A source told<strong> Us</strong> that the split was amicable. "There was no cheating on either side," the insider told <strong>Us</strong> at the time. "They had fallen out of love a while ago."</p><p>Banderas, 54, and Griffith, 57, share one teenage daughter, <strong>Stella</strong>. (The actress is also mom to Fifty Shades of Grey star <strong>Dakota Johnson</strong>, whom she shares with ex <strong>Don Johnson</strong>. Griffith also co-parents and has a son, <strong>Alex Bauer</strong>, with her ex <strong>Steven Bauer</strong>.) In the original filing, the Now and Then star requested full custody of their daughter, in addition to spousal support. According to TMZ, the issue was resolved after Stella celebrated her 18th birthday last fall.</p><p>Despite their high-profile split, the exes reunited at Stella's high school graduation last month, where they posed for family pictures together to celebrate their daughter. "Mama, Stella and Papi. Our angel is amazing," Griffith captioned one pic of her and Banderas with their child. "Beginning the next chapter of her life! Freedom!!"</p><p>This past January, Banderas opened up about his split from Griffith. "Life goes on," he said on Spanish talk show El Hormiguero. "She’s also the person that I loved, that I love, and will always love."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKSepJGjtqZ5xqugn56ZqbVurc2tpqehn2KvorrDnqmaq12otqi6jJ2gr6eimLJuvMCpnKurXaS7pnnYnpirZZyWwaa%2BjGtnam1iZoQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
