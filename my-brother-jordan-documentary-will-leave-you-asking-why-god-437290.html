It is the power that one life can have to impact those around them, even after they leave this earthly realm.</p><p>Though Jordan Robinson‚Äôs life was cut short, Justin‚Äôs documentary has brought Jordan to millions and through this film, Jordan‚Äôs legacy lives on. The example he set for his friends and family is now reaching others through film.</p><p>His message of determination, kindness, humor, and most important of all love has reached the masses.</p><p>Justin Robinson shared an announcement on his official Instagram account that his documentary has surpassed four million views on YouTube.
