The objective is to fill the white squares with letters, forming words or phrases, by solving clues provided for each entry. Typically, the grid is square or rectangular in shape, and the answer words intersect with one another, creating a challenging and rewarding solving experience.</p><p>The origins of crossword puzzles can be traced back to 1913 when Arthur Wynne, a British journalist working in New York City, created the first crossword puzzle for the New York World's Sunday supplement called Fun. Initially named "word-cross," the puzzle quickly gained popularity and was later renamed "crossword puzzle."</p><p>Since then, crossword puzzles have become an integral part of popular culture, captivating puzzle enthusiasts worldwide. They are widely available in various formats, including newspapers, magazines, books, and online platforms. Crossword puzzles are enjoyed by people of all ages, from youngsters developing their language skills to older adults seeking mental stimulation and entertainment.</p><p>The diverse range of crossword puzzles ensures there is something for everyone. Standard crossword puzzles, the most common type, feature straightforward clues and a black-and-white grid. Cryptic crossword puzzles, on the other hand, present more intricate challenges, with puns, wordplay, and hidden meanings in the clues. Diagramless crossword puzzles add an extra layer of difficulty by omitting the black squares, requiring solvers to deduce the grid's layout.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 class=faq_title>Name said twice in an introduction Crossword Clue - FAQs</h2><p>1.
