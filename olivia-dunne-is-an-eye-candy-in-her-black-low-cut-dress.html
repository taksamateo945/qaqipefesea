Dunne traded her usual leotards for a sexy ensemble that put her enviable figure on display.</p><h2>Olivia Dunne’s Little Black Dress</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/02014205/IMG_8480-586x1024.jpg><p>The athlete who turned 21 on October 1st wowed in a short black dress that complemented her glowing complexion. It had a plunging neckline that showcased her décolletage, and the tight fit made her cleavage pop. The garment also had a sleeveless design that bared her sculpted arms and shoulders. In addition, the stretchy material that clung to Dunne’s curves emphasized her flat midsection and hourglass silhouette.</p><p>For the special occasion, the internet sensation wore her blond hair in a center part and styled straight. She let the long strands cascade over her shoulder and back. In terms of accessories, Dunne settled for her favorite Van Cleef & Arpels necklace and a black Prada bag, which provide just the right amount of bling to her outfit.</p><p>She also wore a gorgeous makeup application, including mascara, eyeliner, blush, highlighter, and light pink lipstick.</p><h2>Posing For A Mirror Selfie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/02014158/386135167_1051733332655195_1132355628175728022_n-576x1024.jpg><p>The photo saw Dunne posing in front of a mirror inside her room. She popped her hip to the side and bent one of her knees as she angled her phone’s back camera to the looking glass. While gazing at the mobile device’s screen, the gymnast smiled.</p><p>“Bday din fit ? ” Dunne wrote in the picture.</p><h2>Something Sparkly For 21</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/02014146/385334649_781005920702412_8444355293620614596_n-819x1024.jpg><p>Dunne then changed into a white sequin dress, as seen in snaps posted to her feed hours ago. The piece had thin shoulder straps and a short length, allowing the NCAA hottie to show off her sculpted pins. Its tiny slit athlete exposed more skin, and the skintight material accentuated her hourglass body.</p><p>Like in her previous dress, Dunne also put on a busty display in the sparkly number.</p><p>The gymnast struck several poses while standing against a white wall. She wore a black satin sash with rhinestones that read, “Birthday Girl.”</p><p>“Do your thang 21!? #21,” Dunne wrote in the caption.</p><h2>Birthday Wishes And Compliments Pour In</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/02014151/385496065_1006779770567687_7517951366197361267_n-819x1024.jpg><p>Fans wasted no time showing the post some love.

If one of us went out in Baton Rouge [La.] by ourselves, there’s probably gonna be someone there asking for something — picture, autograph, whatever,” he said.</p><p>“It’s nice to be able to have that conversation. She does get it. I do wish she could come to a baseball game and just enjoy it. It does irk me. I don’t have any control over it. She really doesn’t either. I’m sure it’ll get better as I go up levels, but that’s something I want for her,” Skenes added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnn6G2t7XAZpuupp6aeqq%2FjJqlZp2pmnqkrc2dsGahnmK1pr6Mm6Oam5tiubDDjJysrWWUp7K0v44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
