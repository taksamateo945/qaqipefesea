She also has a sister named Jennifer Ann Dybsky. Leutner attended and graduated high school at Chantilly High School where she played lacrosse for the high school varsity girls’ team.</p><p>“It was always a job that I wanted to do, so when I got to see them I was really excited,” <a href=#><u>she said</u></a>. “It was really a dream come true. At that point, sports was really my main focus.”</p><p>Kathy Leutner developed an interest in modeling at a young age. After graduating from high school, she decided to skip college and pursue her modeling career.</p><p>Despite a rough road early in her career wherein, she appeared in multiple advertisements and commercial ads, she eventually got her big break when she modeled for Fitness Magazine. Her height and athletic build made her a perfect fit to be the magazine cover.</p><p>In 2011, Kathy Leutner was part of Sports Illustrated’s Swimsuit model search. Despite being featured, she failed to win the competition. On top of that, she had a lot of projects with different brands such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Naked, Famous, Faviana, and Hollister Co., among others.</p><p>Her physical features are one of the major assets that really help her in her job as a model. She stands at 5 feet 8 inches (172 centimeters), weighs 62 kilograms (137 lbs), has body measurements of 34-25-36 inches (90-60-90), and has gorgeous blonde hair to top it all off.</p><p>In a 2011 interview, Kathy Leutner shared that having her hair down, not wearing a lot of makeup, and just being confident about herself makes her feel the sexiest. She also said that memories with her family and friends make her happy.</p><p>Leutner shared that her father, who was raised outside Philadelphia, raised her to become a Philadelphia Eagles fan. Despite living just outside Washington, she still supports the Eagles.</p><p></p><p>According to <a href=#><u>Players Bio</u></a>, Kathy Leutner has a net worth of $1.2 million as of 2022. She also earns an average salary of $132,000.</p><p>As for her relationship with the <a href=#><u>Pittsburgh Penguins</u></a>&nbsp;captain, Sidney Crosby and Kathy Leutner reportedly met through a mutual friend back in 2008. Despite not having much information about the couple, it is believed that they have been dating for more than a decade now.</p><p>During that time, both of their careers were just starting to take off. Crosby has been piling on wins for the Penguins and racking on individual awards for himself. Leutner, on the other hand, was busy with all of the modeling jobs and deals that she had. Incredibly, the couple still kept their personal lives private.</p><p>On February 20, 2021, Kathy Leutner was present when the Pittsburgh Penguins and the NHL honored Sidney Crosby for his 1,000th&nbsp;career game.</p><p></p><p>Due to having a very private relationship, many are often speculating about the relationship status of the couple. Some suggest that they are privately married, while some wonder if they are even engaged. Nevertheless, it is no question that Sidney Crosby and Kathy Leutner continue to support each other in their personal and professional endeavors.</p><p>It is only a matter of time when news breaks out that the couple of more than a decade decides to tie the knot. As of right now, they seem to be happy and content with their lives. Nonetheless, this is all the information we currently have on Sidney Crosby's girlfriend Kathy Leutner</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnKrBpLTPqKCnrKNjsLC5jqygnaaVrnqkvs6smbKrXZy2s7jFq6CeppRiuKLAx7JkpZ2lqbumvg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
