My emotions have been so up and down this year. One minute I feel like I can handle things, and the next, I’m overwhelmed with #anxiety and #fear and #sadness about what’s going on in our world. But then, I take a moment and take a deep breath and literally mediate on the #positives. I say all this to say, please take care of your #mentalhealth during these trying times. It’s important. 🙏🏽 #meditation #breath”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CBfxOV1jGg6/</p><p>A follower stated: “I just got done watching your life 😭😭😭your words really meant a lot to me I’m going through depression bad, and I’ve had a rough couple of days you have no idea how much the live is helping me thank you soo much @tiamowry miss you on sister sister ❤️your fan, Sarah.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CBQZbduFN9G/</p><p>This person chimed in: “I love you.
