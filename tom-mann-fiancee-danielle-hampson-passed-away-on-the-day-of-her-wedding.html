Mann broke the news on Instagram with a touching image including Danielle and their son Bowie. The caption stated:</p><p>“Dani, my closest friend, my everything and more, the love of my life, died in the early hours of Saturday morning, June 18th. What was intended to be the greatest day of our life turned out to be the most heartbreaking. I feel like I’ve shed an ocean of tears.”</p><p>He bemoaned the fact that they never got to speak wedding vows or dance together, but he said that she was “the finest thing that ever happened to me.” He also said that he would do all in his ability to raise their son, Bowie, in the manner that they had envisioned. Mann concluded by saying:</p><p>“My dear Dani, the brightest light in any room, without you, my world is nothing but darkness. I shall always miss you.”</p><p></p><h2>Danielle Hampson, Tom Mann’s late fiancée, was all we knew about her.</h2><p>Danielle Hampson worked as a public relations professional at Knowles Communications. She was also a professional dancer who appeared in Harry Styles’ Treat People With Kindness music video. At the time, she wrote:</p><p>“To all the dancers I had the pleasure of sharing these days with, they were unwittingly my last as a dancer. You are the glitter that the world needs, and I hope you get to shine again soon.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Danielle-Hampson-2.jpg alt="Danielle Hampson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Danielle and Mann started dating in 2015 and got engaged in 2019. In June 2021, she revealed her pregnancy. Mann has yet to uncover the reason for Hampson’s death, which occurred while she was just 34 years old. For the time being, further information on her family, work, and educational history are unknown.</p><p>She is presently trending on social media as a result of Mann’s heartfelt tribute on Instagram. He subsequently shared a quotation from Hampson on his Instagram Story in January 2019. Mann’s Instagram post received a flurry of responses, with celebrities like Lewis Capaldi, Mimi Webb, Tom Grennan, SG Lewis, Luke Dumont, and Gabrielle Aplin offering their sympathies.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Danielle-Hampson-3.jpg alt="Danielle Hampson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>All About Tom Mann</h2><p>Tom Mann, who was born on November 3, 1993, is a singer-songwriter who rose to prominence after appearing on The X Factor in 2014.
