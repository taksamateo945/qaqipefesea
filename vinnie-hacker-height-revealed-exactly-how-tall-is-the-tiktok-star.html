Understandably, this has led to a form of inquisition on what he did to achieve them and also about what he does to maintain those chiseled abs. The long and short of it is that Vinnie maintains a rather strict workout routine and diet.</p><p>His workout routine includes cardio, which for all intents and purposes involves running on a treadmill or the classic morning run. The TikTok star also maintains an active interest in boxing, and his routine includes an hour of pounding it out with a sparring partner or the old-fashioned punching bag.</p><p>Next, he engages in a series of weight training that focuses on the upper part of his body. Vinnie is also quite cautious of what he eats. All these factors have led to a very trim physique and a healthy body weight of 78.5 kg (173 lbs).</p><p>Other body measurements include 42-30-14.5 inches for his chest, waist, and biceps, respectively. On his handsome face are a pair of hazel-colored eyes.
