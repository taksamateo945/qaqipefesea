However, if players are stuck on their last try and don’t want to sacrifice their streak, they could use some hints to guess today’s answer. While Wordle does give visual clues to players, many times, especially for today’s answer, it isn’t enough to point players in the right direction.

With each five-letter word guess, the game responds by changing the color of a box depending on whether the letter is being used in today’s answer. For example, if a box’s color changes to green, that means the letter in that box is being used in today’s Wordle answer and is in the right spot. However, if the box’s color turns yellow, that means the letter is being used in today’s answer but isn’t in the right place. Finally, if the box’s color remains unchanged, that means the letter is not being used anywhere in today’s Wordle answer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single data-preserver-spaces=true>Related: <a href=#>Best Wordle Word Combos To Start With</a></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Once players are done attempting the Wordle puzzle, they can share their results with the rest of the world on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Players can do so by clicking on the “Share” button, which copies a set of color emoji boxes (green and yellow) and the number of attempts it took the player to guess the answer. What’s cool is that these boxes can be understood by other players who know the rules and already know <a href=#>today’s Wordle answer</a>. It’s worth pointing out that these emojis do not spoil the answer for others as they only represent the correct and incorrect usage of letters.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Wordle’s March 16, 2022 (#270) Hints & Answers</span></h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Some players like to get hints about today’s Wordle anger that helps them solve today’s puzzle. These hints are similar to what players may have seen before in crossword puzzles and give a bit more context to the player. Here are some hints that might help players guess today’s Wordle answer:</span></p><ul><li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hint 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Provide food and drinks at special events</span></li><li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hint 2:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;Supply food&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hint 3:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;A synonym for words like provide, pander, kowtow or pamper</span></li></ul><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Wordle 270 Answer (March 16)</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>If players were unable to guess today’s Wordle answer by using the hints above, the solution is&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>CATER</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. When trying to guess today’s answer, the first word we used was “WATER,” which revealed four letters being used in the correct spot. However, this is where it got tricky as the next word we used was “LATER,” which did not yield the correct answer. The third attempt had a similar result as we used the word “HATER,” and it did not reveal <a href=#>today’s Wordle answer</a> either. Finally, with luck, we could guess today’s <strong>Wordle</strong> answer CATER in our fourth attempt.</span></p><p><span class=next-single data-preserver-spaces=true>More: <a href=#>Today’s Wordle Answer: All Words For 2022 (Updated Daily)</a></span></p><p><strong><span class=next-btn-text-title>Ms. Marvel Creator Reacts To Show’s First Trailer & Highlights Easter Egg</span></strong></p><p><strong class=section-sub-title>About The Author</strong></p><strong class=bio-title><br>Akshay Bhalla<br><span class=amount>(46 Articles Published)</span><br></strong><p>Akshay Bhalla is a Game Guides Editor for Screen Rant based out of New Delhi, India.
